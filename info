<p>Here we have a picture of a fictional basketball player and this show is what got me into basketball pretty much.</p>
<p> I think i'm quite decent at the sport but we'll find out by seeing if I get into the team or not.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Kobe </li>
  <li>Kyrie Irving </li>
  <li>Lebron James </li>
  <li>Michael Jordan </li>
